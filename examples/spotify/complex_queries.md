Here are some complex user queries based on Spotify's OpenAPI spec that require chaining multiple API calls:

1. **"Show me the top tracks of artists similar to my favorite artist."**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Use the `GET /artists/{id}` to find the user's favorite artist by ID.
     2. Use the `GET /artists/{id}/related-artists` to fetch related artists.
     3. For each related artist, use `GET /artists/{id}/top-tracks` to get their top tracks.
   
2. **"Find all albums from my favorite artists and add their latest tracks to a new playlist."**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Use `GET /me` to retrieve the current user's profile.
     2. Use `GET /artists/{id}/albums` for each favorite artist to find their albums.
     3. Use `GET /albums/{id}/tracks` to fetch the latest tracks from each album.
     4. Use `POST /users/{user_id}/playlists` to create a new playlist.
     5. Use `POST /playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks` to add the tracks to the newly created playlist.
   
3. **"Find podcasts and episodes related to a specific genre and save them to my library."**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Use `GET /search` with the genre filter for podcasts and episodes.
     2. For each podcast, use `GET /shows/{id}/episodes` to fetch its episodes.
     3. Use `PUT /me/episodes` to save the selected episodes to the user's library.
   
4. **"Recommend playlists based on albums I recently saved, and add tracks from those playlists to my library."**
   - **Steps**:
     1. Use `GET /me/albums` to retrieve recently saved albums.
     2. For each album, use `GET /albums/{id}/tracks` to get its tracks.
     3. Use `GET /browse/featured-playlists` to find recommended playlists.
     4. Use `GET /playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks` to get the tracks from recommended playlists.
     5. Use `PUT /me/tracks` to add those tracks to the user's library.

These queries require multiple API calls across different endpoints to achieve their goals.
